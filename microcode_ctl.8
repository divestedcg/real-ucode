.SH DESCRIPTION
." Add any additional description here
.PP
The microcode_ctl utility is a companion to the IA32 microcode driver written
by Tigran Aivazian <tigran@aivazian.fsnet.co.uk>. The uaility has two uses:
.br
.PP
\fBa)\fR it decodes and sends new microcode to the kernel driver to be
uploaded to Intel IA32 processors. (Pentium Pro, PII, Celeron, PIII,
Xeon, Pentium 4 etc)
.PP
\fBb)\fR it signals the kernel driver to release the buffers containing the
copy of microcode data actually applied to given CPU, linear array of 2048
bytes per CPU, see struct microcode in include/asm/processor.h for
information on the layout of chunks buffers may hold
.br
.PP
The microcode update is volatile and needs to be uploaded on each system
boot i.e. it doesn't reflash your cpu permanently, reboot and it reverts
back to the old microcode.
.br
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
display usage and exit
.TP
\fB\-u\fR
upload microcode (from default filename)
.TP
\fB\-f\fR
upload microcode from named Intel formatted file
.TP
\fB\-q\fR
run silently when successful
.TP
\fB\-Q\fR
run silently even on failure
